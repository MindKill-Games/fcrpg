Text-based RPG still ongoing development.

Hello there!, this is the public repository for Fort Carson RPG, a text-based RPG game being developed in BlitzBASIC, it is currently ongoing heavy development and is not finished, and probably is not compileable.
Current uses for everything:
items.bb manages items, currently only being used in the development of the health system since we need to account for bandages and such.
economy.bb manages the shops troughout the world, every shop is a function that is called when needed, pretty modular, isn´t it?
health.bb, also known as the fifth layer of hell, manages everything about the player´s health and states, if you have a strong fetish for If,Then,Or,And; you will like that file.
skills.bb should and will be expanded upon, it manages traits and player skills.
core.bb is not used, it shall be used to hold the story.

This is a first for me, i´ve been learning Blitz for a little while now and wanted to put my skills to the test for this one, i commend you, the person that is probably more competent than me, for going trough the hell that might be reading trough all of the code here.
Also, emphasis on "heavy development", there is almost nothing here still. -Heitor
